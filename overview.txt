Purpose: a local, client-side 3D graphics simulation where objects move according to defined behaviors. 

The object properties include shape, color, size, position, and movement behavior. Movement can be a defined path, following another object, or orbiting. 

The user interface consists of a web browser-based 3D rendering panel, a chat-like command interface, and a status panel for messages. 

Commands allow adding, modifying, and controlling objects. 

Help is available though the command line as in linux (e.g. start --help). 

There is error handling for invalid commands and command history navigation. 

Configuration includes arena size and frame rate. 

The logic will be modular, initially in JavaScript and three.js, but allowing future extension, such as swapping in a more powerful backend. The entire application will run on the user's computer.

We will allow exporting and importing scripts to restore states. 

Testing will involve sample scripts to validate the system.
